(2 points) Fix each of the following common data frame subsetting errors: 

mtcars[mtcars$cyl < 6]    Error -->   undefined columns selected
Solution --> Add a comma after defining the objective.

Answer--> mtcars[mtcars$cyl< 6,]




mtcars[-1:3,]   Error--> only 0's may be mixed with negative subscripts
Solution --> make numbers; both negative, 
                           both positive,
                           first one zero with second one positive, 
                           or first one negative with second one zero.
                           
Answer --> I dont know the intention of this question, so I will add several answers.
           (if we say)     x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
           if you want to exclude both the 1st and 3rd elements
           Answer --> x[-c(3, 1)]   OR  x[c(-1, -3)]
           
           if you want to include the 3rd element only
           Answer --> x[c(3)]
