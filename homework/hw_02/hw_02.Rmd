Fix each of the following common data frame subsetting errors: 


mtcars[mtcars$cyl < 6]    Error -->   undefined columns selected
Solution --> Add a comma after defining the objective.

Answer--> mtcars[mtcars$cyl< 6,]




mtcars[-1:3,]   Error--> only 0's may be mixed with negative subscripts
Solution --> make numbers; both negative, 
                           both positive,
                           first one zero with second one positive, 
                           or first one negative with second one zero
                           Depending on the intention of what you want to do.
                           
Answer --> I dont know the intention of this question, so I will add two possible answers.
           (if we say)     x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
           if you want to exclude both the 1st and 3rd elements
           Answer --> x[-c(3, 1)]   OR  x[c(-1, -3)]
           
           if you want to include the 3rd element only
           Answer --> x[c(3)]
           
           
           
mtcars[mtcars$cyl = 8, ] Error--> unexpected '=' in "mtcars[mtcars$cyl ="
Solution --> add == instead of =

Answer --> mtcars[mtcars$cyl == 8, ]




mtcars[mtcars$cyl == 4 | 6, ]   It gave a wrong answer 
Solution --> Use the right Syntax


Answer --> mtcars[mtcars$cyl == 4 | mtcars$cyl == 6, ]

Why does the following code generated five missing values?

x = 1:5
x[NA]

Answer --> Because you need to add c function that is used to get the output by giving parameters inside the function.
Solution to get output -->  x[c(1: 5)]

Why does mtcars[1:15] return an error? How does it differ from mtcars[1:15, ]?


Because in mtcars[1:15] R does not understand the column you want to use while subsetting the data frame as the syntax is not complete.
